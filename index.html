  <h1>View A House Address in Google Maps/Bing Maps</h1>
  
  <p>
    This super simple add-on takes a selected address and views that address in Google Maps or Bird's Eye view in Bing Maps, to help you visualize the address easier.
  </p>
  <p>This is intended to be used with MLS site in Canada, to help you visualize an MLS listing.</p>
  
  <p>Simply highlight an address on the page, right-click and select one of 3 possible view methods. (Street View doesn't currently work)</p>
  
  <p>The original goal was to have it directly tied into an MLS page, but I haven't got the jetpack/jquery selection working, since I don't access to the docs yet.</p>
  
  
  <p>Options include:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Maps Street View</strong> - view the house in street view</li>
    <li><strong>Google Maps Satellite View</strong> - view the house in Satellite View</li>
    <li><strong>Bing Maps Bird's Eye View</strong> - View the house with Bing's awesome Bird's eye view</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Note, some views may not be available, based on where the house is located, and whether the views are supported in the maps</p>
