Neighbourhood jetpack add-on for Firefox
by John Tajima


This is a super simple jetpack (http://jetpack.mozillalabs.com) add-on for firefox that takes a highlighted address 
and provides a context-menu link to view that address in:
- Google Maps Satellite View
- Google Maps Street View (not working yet)
- Bing Maps Bird's Eye View

The original goal was to link it with Canada's MLS (realtors.ca) website so that you can easily 
view an MLS listing address in these maps. This would help better visualize the house, 
and the neighbourhood it's in, without having to cut and paste to different websites.

Since I didn't have access to jetpack docs, I simply show the context menus all the time, 
and you are required to highlight the address.

I will change this so that it automatically recognizes the MLS website, and only shows the options when 
you are on a valid MLS listing page.

Installation:
-------------
Check the jetpack documentation (http://jetpack.mozillalabs.com)


Usage (for now):
----------------

- Highlight an address on a webpage (ie: "123 Elm St., Ottawa, ON" text on a webpage, like an MLS listing page)
- Right-click to get the context menu
- Select one of the 3 possible map views
