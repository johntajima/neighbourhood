Neighbourhood 
a mozilla Jetpack add-on for viewing house addresses quickly on Google/Bing Maps
by John Tajima
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple tool that will help you view a house in: 
  a) Google Maps' Satellite View, 
  b) Google Maps' Street View, 
  c) Bing Maps' Birds Eye View

Simply highlight an address on a webpage, right-click and select one of the 3 maps 
to view the address in.

I wrote this to help us when we are searching for houses to quickly the view 
neighbourhood the house is located in, without having to copy-and-paste into 
the maps each time.
